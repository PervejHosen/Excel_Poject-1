Super Store Sales Dashboard
This is a 4 years of a Super store sales data.
Used Tools:
i) Power Query. ii) Merge. iii) Data cleaning.
iv) Modeling. v) Custom Column.
vi) Conditional Column. vii) Pivot Table
viii) Math Function. ix) Different Charts.

Firstly I take the data into power query of excel, Where I clean the data, do data modeling, use merge queries, append queries and load the data as a table format. Then I use some functions and most of the work is done by Pivot Table. Its a two sheet dashboard. First page for Sales Analysis and the other one for Product Analysis.
